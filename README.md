## Multi-Layer Network Configuration - CISCO Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
A multi-layer network implemented with CISCO Packet Tracer to simulate enterprise-level network integration, configured with advanced protocols including OSPF, EIGRP, STP, and HSRP to ensure efficient routing, with secure WAN connections utilizing Frame Relay and PPP, alongside ACLs and port security to bolster network defenses.

## Features

- A multi-layer network structure with scalable network design.
- To prevent Layer 2 loops, configurations include VLAN setup and EtherChannel for link aggregation.
- Employs OSPF and EIGRP protocols to ensure routing through network segments efficiently.
- To provide network redundancy, HSRP is integrated.
- WAN connections are configured using Frame Relay and PPP.
- To enforce security policies, ACLs are utilized.
- For automatic IP address allocation, DHCP servers are set up.
